# EMS-Based Simulation of Touch Sensations in Wearables

This repository contains all materials related to the project **EMS-Based Simulation of Touch Sensations in Wearables**, including:

- 📂 **Source Code** – implementation of the wearable prototype, EMS control, and sensor integration  
- 📄 **Questionnaires** – study material such as the Comfort Rating Scale (CRS) and EMS-CORE questionnaire  
- ⚙️ **3D Models & Hardware Files** – 3D-printed sleeve, electrode mounts, and case designs  

## Overview

The project explores how **Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS)** can be used in a wearable form factor to generate subtle, natural, and comfortable touch sensations.  
A prototype was developed combining a **3D-printed sleeve**, **EMS electrodes**, a **Trill touch sensor**, and microcontroller-based signal processing.  

The repository serves as a central collection for **development**, **experiments**, and **evaluation materials**.
